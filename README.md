# sfml-2d-platformer

Prototype for a 2D platformer game.

Written in C++ 11, using the graphics library SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

This project implements an entity–component–system and a grid-based platformer framework.

## Build & install

To build this project, you need SFML, `version 2.3.2`.

Then, simply `make` and run `bin/game`.

This project requires a Linux machine to run. Other operative systems are not supported.


## Controls

WASD to move, space bar to jump.

Right click slows time, left click teleports you while in slow-mo.
